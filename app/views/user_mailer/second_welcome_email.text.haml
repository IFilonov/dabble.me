Dabble Me helps you remember what's happened in your life - now that you've written your first entry, you're well on your way. That's something to feel good about! If you have any questions you can send an email to hello@#{ENV['MAIN_DOMAIN']}.
\ 
- if @user.send_past_entry? && @first_entry.present?
  Here's what you wrote...
  \ 
  #{@first_entry.sanitized_body}
  \ 
You can check out your entry here: https://#{ENV['MAIN_DOMAIN']}/past
\ 
- if @user.frequencies.present?
  \ 
  \ 
  P.S. You'll receive emails every #{@user.frequencies} at #{@user.send_time.strftime("%-I %P")} #{@user.send_timezone}. Change your settings here: https://#{ENV['MAIN_DOMAIN']}/settings/#{@user.user_key}
- else
  \ 
  P.S. You have email reminders turned off, so you won't receive prompts in the future. Change your settings here: https://#{ENV['MAIN_DOMAIN']}/settings/#{@user.user_key}
